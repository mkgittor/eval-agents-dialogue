# Report Generation Agent

This code implements an example of a Report Generation Agent for single-table relational
data source, including a demo agent demo UI and evaluations with [Langfuse](https://langfuse.com/).

The data source implemented here is an [SQLite](https://sqlite.org/) database which is
supported natively by Python and saves the data in disk.
[SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) is used as a SQL connection tool so this
SQL connection can be easily swapped for other databases.

The Report Generation Agent will provide an UI to read user queries in natural language
and proceed to make SQL queries to the database in order to produce the data for
the report. At the end, the Agent will provide a downloadable link to the report as
an `.xlsx` file.

This example also provides agent monitoring and evaluations using Langfuse.

Below is a diagram of the system:

### Running the Demo

To run the demo, you can choose to follow the steps below or follow the instructions
in the notebooks in this folder.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this example is the
[Online Retail](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/352/online+retail) dataset. It contains
information about invoices for products that were purchased by customers, which also includes
product quantity, the invoice date and the country that the customer resides in. For a more
detailed data structure, please check the [OnlineRetail.ddl](data/Online%20Retail.ddl) file.

## Importing the Data

To import the data, please download the dataset file from the link below and save it to your
file system.

https://archive.ics.uci.edu/static/public/352/online+retail.zip

You can import the dataset to the database by running the script below:

```bash
uv run --env-file .env python -m implementations.report_generation.data.import_online_retail_data --dataset-path <path_to_the_csv_file>
```

Replace `<path_to_the_csv_file>` with the path the dataset's .CSV file is saved in your machine.

***NOTE:*** The location the database is saved is determined by an environment variable
named `REPORT_GENERATION_DB__DATABASE`.

## Running the Demo UI

To run the agent, please execute:

```bash
uv run --env-file .env python -m implementations.report_generation.demo
```

The agent will be available through a [Gradio](https://www.gradio.app/) web UI under the
local address http://127.0.0.1:7860, which can be accessed on your preferred browser.

On the UI, there will be a few examples of requests you can make to this agent. It also
features a text input so you can make your own report requests to it.

The agent will automatically upload a trace to Langfuse that can be used to evaluate
the run or debug any issues.

### Running the agent using Google ADK

If you wish to run the agent using the Google Agent Development Kit UI,
please run the command below from the project's root folder:

```bash
adk web implementations/
```

Once the service is up, it will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`. On the
"Select an Agent" dropdown, please select "report_generation". You can type a request to
the agent on the text box on the right hand side panel.



## Running the Evaluations

### Uploading the Ground Truth Dataset to Langfuse

Before running the evaluations, the ground truth dataset needs to be uploaded to
Langfuse first.

To do so with the [sample ground-truth dataset](data/OnlineRetailReportEval.json)
in this repository, please run:

```bash
uv run --env-file .env python -m implementations.report_generation.data.langfuse_upload
```

To upload custom data or use a different dataset name, please run:

```bash
uv run --env-file .env python -m implementations.report_generation.data.langfuse_upload --dataset-path <path/to/dataset.json> --dataset-name <dataset name>
```

### Running the Offline Evaluation Script

Once the dataset has been uploaded to Langfuse, the offline evaluations
against a pre-determined dataset can be run with the command below:

```bash
uv run --env-file .env python -m implementations.report_generation.evaluate
```

To run the offline evaluations against a custom dataset, please execute:

```bash
uv run --env-file .env python -m implementations.report_generation.evaluate --dataset-name <dataset name>
```

This script will run the Report Generation Agent against each element of the dataset
and then use LLM-as-a-judge Evaluator Agents to evaluate each result. The evaluator
will check the data generated to produce the report and also the trajectory the
agent used against the ground truth and produce True/False scores along with a reasoning.

At the end of the run, an evaluation report will be displayed along with a link
to check details about the evaluation in Langfuse.

### Online Evaluations

The agent is also set to collect online evaluation metrics in both the Gradio Demo UI
and the Google ADK UI. The online evaluations will check if the token usage and execution
time are higher than a certain threshold defined in the code, and it will also
check if the final result is present and contains a link to the report.

Those evaluation results will be sent to Langfuse as scores, where they can be analyzed
both in an aggregate fashion as well as individually.

### User Feedback

On the Gradio Demo UI, there are two buttons to record user feedback: a thumbs
up button to record positive user feedback and a thumbs down button to record
negative user feedback. The buttons will appear at the end of the agent's execution
and it will record the user feedback as Langfuse scores.
